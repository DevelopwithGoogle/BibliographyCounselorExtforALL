Citation Recommendation is to provide bibliographic citation that a user is intending to fetch corresponding to a search query. This task differs from paper recommendation where it recommends documents that are worthwhile to read and to investigate. Survey publications have the sole objective to satisfy paper recommendation. __Bibliography Counselor__ is such a recommendation system integrated with __Overleaf__.
